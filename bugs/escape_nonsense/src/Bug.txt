I was trying to add a custom command that used single quotes and ran into an issue with escaping/quoting.
The following is a fairly minimal test case, note this is with 3.28.1 on Windows. I am using the Visual Studio generator.
So I have a CMakeLists.txt file that looks like
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)

project(hello_world)

add_executable(hello_world HelloWorld.cpp)

add_custom_command(
    TARGET hello_world
    COMMAND  echo ' > Foo.out
    COMMENT  Stuff
    VERBATIM)
```
So the intent here is to write a single quote character into a text file called Foo.out. However the text file has the text `"'"` added. If I look at the command line in the generated Visual Studio project it's
`echo "'" &gt; Foo.out`
The &gt; makes sense here as the VS output is an XML file so the '>' was correctly converted to `\&gt;`
The question is why are the double quotes added?
I tried every alternative I could think of like `\'` which also produced `"'"`.
Nothing I could find would write out an unquoted single quote. 
I am wondering if CMake thinks that a single quote is a special character on a windows command line but I don't think it is. 
Comands like `echo ' > tmp` and `dir '` are perfectly valid although weird looking. 

So maybe there is a way to do what I'm trying but if there is it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.
On the documentation front I think it would be extremely useful to have a bunch of examples that show some text in a CMakeLists.text and what will actually appear in a generated Visual Studio project. 
The documentation at https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#escape-sequences is all I could find and it doesn't help here in the slightest.
